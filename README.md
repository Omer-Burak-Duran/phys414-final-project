# PHYS414:Computational Physics Final Project
This is the repository for the **Final Project** of **PHYS414: Computational Physics** course, *Ko√ß University, Fall 2024*


## Code:
The code is written in **Python** language, version **3.12.2**

Every Part has its own corresponding Python file: *newton_parta.py, newton_partb.py* and so on.


## Visualizations and Report:
Any plots, graphs, illustrations, and visualizations will be saved under the folder named "**plots**"

The report "**FinalProjectReport.pdf**" has explanations for the code and the mathematical computations done for this project.

To see the outputs and the plots, one can individually run any part, for example "*python newton_partc.py*".

Alternatively, to see the outputs of all parts of Newton section, run *newton_all.py* and for Einstein section run *einstein_all.py*

It is possible to run *all.py* to see all outputs of both Newton and Einstein section.
